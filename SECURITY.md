# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Use the following table as a reference as to which versions are supported
with security updates, keep in mind that the versions with the "X" symbol
will NEVER be updated as their commit-period is over. We follow a strict *two*
version security policy, e.g only two versions will be supported at a time.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| NET/2   | :white_check_mark: |
| NET/1   | :white_check_mark: |
| 386     | :x:                |
| 1.0.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open an issue (which you can do on the "issues"
tab of the github repo) and label it as a security issue (by maybe starting the
commit header with *[SECURITY]* or something).

Please keep in mind that it might take a while as pearlOS is a one-man project as
I'm writing this, so it might take up to a week or so, but if it's an actual
emergency security issue, just remember that I'm not stupid and could probably
fix it in a day maximum.

When reporting an issue, it might be a good idea to provide *screenshots*, it's
also ideal that you provide steps to replicate the problem, e.g:

* Go to \[...]
* Type \[...]
* Click \[...]
