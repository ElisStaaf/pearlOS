pearlOS: Operating System
=========================
pearlOS is an awesome operating system based of the pidiOS (https://github.com/GandelXIV/pidi-os)
project that was sadly discontinued, but I *highly* recommend you to check out the new rust-based
operating system made by the same author; RezOS (https://github.com/GandelXIV/RezOS)
But ofcourse only do that *after* you check out this project! pearlOS was made
for me to learn operating system things and also to become better at C and Assembly.

Requirements
------------
* https://www.gnu.org/software/make
* https://nasm.us
* https://gcc.gnu.org
* https://www.qemu.org

Installation
------------
To install, clone the repo and run some installation scripts, like so:

    git clone https://github.com/ElisStaaf/pearlOS
    cd pearlOS
    ./configure
    make
    qemu-system-i386 dist/os-image.bin

So yeah, contributions are of course *very* welcome, and remember; this is *very much* a WIP, so
don't judge my code *too* hard. But most importantly: Enjoy!
