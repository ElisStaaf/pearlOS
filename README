pearlOS: Operating system
=========================

pearlOS is an awesome operating system based of the pidiOS (https://github.com/GandelXIV/pidi-os)
project that was sadly discontinued, but I *highly* recommend you to check out the new rust-based
operating system made by the same author; RezOS (https://github.com/GandelXIV/RezOS)
But ofcourse only do that *after* you check out this project! pearlOS was made
for me to learn operating system things and also to become better at C and Assembly.

Requirements
------------

* https://www.gnu.org/software/make
* https://nasm.us
* https://gcc.gnu.org
* https://www.qemu.org

Installation
------------

PearlOS prides itself in it's incredibly easy installation, as it only requires 3 commands!
It's very easy to install, firstly clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/ElisStaaf/pearlOS

After going into the repo directory, run configure and then make:

    ./configure
    make

Lastly, run the generated image at dist/pearl.bin:

    qemu-system-i386 dist/pearl.bin

This will start up a QEMU session with the image, and you
can run the OS.

Contributing
------------

If you want to contribute, you can. And if the contribution helps the OS in any way,
then I'll accept it. That's the policy at pearlOS.
