pearlOS: Operating System
============================
pearlOS is an awesome operating system based of the pidiOS (https://github.com/GandelXIV/pidi-os)
project that was sadly discontinued, but I *highly* recommend you to check out the new rust-based
operating system made by the same author; RezOS (https://github.com/GandelXIV/RezOS)
But ofcourse only do that *after* you check out this project! pearlOS was made
for me to learn operating system things and also to become better at C and Assembly.

Requirements
------------
* https://www.gnu.org/software/make
* https://nasm.us
* https://gcc.gnu.org
* https://www.qemu.org

Installation
------------
To be honest, I don't really know how to build on any other operating system except linux, and
even for linux (since I haven't tested it yet) I kinda just guessed? So yeah, here are the
*linux* installation instructions:

    make
    qemu

So yeah, contributions are of course *very* welcome, and remember; this is *very much* a WIP, so
don't judge my code *too* hard. But most importantly: Enjoy!
